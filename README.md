Homework
Personal repository used to upload my homework assignments for the Scalefocus DevOps Academy.

My name is Filip Daskalovski, and I am a 24-year-old master's student in Financial Management at UKIM. Prior to this, I completed my studies in IT Management. I have gained valuable work experience through my roles as an Operations and Support Engineer at Seavus for one year and as an IT Billing System Specialist at A1 Telekom for half a year. 
I am now keen to pursue a career at Scalefocus and utilize my skills and experience to contribute to the success of the company.
That's why I'm thrilled at the opportunity to join the team at Scalefocus, where I can continue to develop my capabilities and contribute to the company's success.

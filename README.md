# Homework
Personal repository used to upload my homework assignments for the Scalefocus DevOps Academy.

Little bit about me: 
My name Filip and last name is Daskalovski. 24 years old. I am currently halfway of my masters studies in Financial Management at UKIM, previously completed IT Managment. 
I have 1 year experience as a Operations and Support Engineer at Seavus, and half a yaer experience as a IT Billing System Specialist at A1 Telekom. And would most definitely love to get the opportunity to work at Scalefocus.

DOCX_FILES_ThatWereCorrupted and .pdf(corrupted_files) folders contain homework assignments that were uploaded before the deadline, but are displayed as corrupeted(they were edited with Open Office Writer), redid them with Office Word.

Lecture_Labs contains all the labs and assignments that were completed during the lectures.

My name is Filip Daskalovski, and I am a 24-year-old master's student in Financial Management at UKIM. Prior to this, I completed my studies in IT Management. I have gained valuable work experience through my roles as an Operations and Support Engineer at Seavus for one year and as an IT Billing System Specialist at A1 Telekom for half a year. 
I am now keen to pursue a career at Scalefocus and utilize my skills and experience to contribute to the success of the company.
With my passion for learning, strong work ethic, and collaborative mindset, I am eager to contribute to the success of the company and enhance my professional capabilities.
